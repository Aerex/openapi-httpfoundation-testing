Increase your API's robustness by validating your HttpFoundation responses against OpenAPI 3.0 definitions in your integration tests.

## Why?

[OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification/) is a specification intended to describe RESTful APIs built with any language, for the API to be understood by humans and machines alike.

Validating HTTP responses against an OpenAPI definition makes it the single source of truth for our API, as we ensure that the API's behaviour conforms to the documentation we provide.

The [HttpFoundation component](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/http_foundation.html) is developed and maintained as part of the [Symfony framework](https://symfony.com/), and is used to handle HTTP requests and responses in Symfony, Laravel, Drupal, and many other major industry players (see the [extended list](https://symfony.com/components/HttpFoundation)).

## How does it work?

This package is built upon the [OpenAPI PSR-7 Message Validator](https://github.com/thephpleague/openapi-psr7-validator) package, which validates [PSR-7 messages](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/) against OpenAPI definitions.

It essentially converts HttpFoundation response objects to PSR-7 messages using Symfony's [PSR-7 Bridge](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/psr7.html), before passing them on to the OpenAPI PSR-7 Message Validator.

## Install

Via Composer:

``` bash
$ composer require --dev osteel/openapi-httpfoundation-testing
```

> ðŸ’¡ This package is meant to be used for development only, as part of your test suite.

## Usage

First, import the builder in the class that will perform the validation:

```php
use Osteel\OpenApi\Testing\ResponseValidatorBuilder;
```

Use the builder to create a `Osteel\OpenApi\Testing\ResponseValidator` object, feeding it a YAML or JSON OpenAPI definition:

```php
$validator = ResponseValidatorBuilder::fromYaml('my-definition.yaml')->getValidator();

// or

$validator = ResponseValidatorBuilder::fromJson('my-definition.json')->getValidator();
```

> ðŸ’¡ Instead of a file, you can also pass a YAML or JSON string directly.

You can now validate a `Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response` object for a given [path](https://swagger.io/specification/#paths-object) and method:

```php
$validator->validate('/users', 'post', $response);
```

> ðŸ’¡ For convenience, responses implementing `Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface` are also accepted.

In the example above, we check that the response matches the OpenAPI definition for a `POST` request on the `/users` path.

Each of OpenAPI's supported HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS` and `TRACE`) also has a shortcut method that calls `validate` under the hood, meaning the line above could also be written this way:

```php
$validator->post('/users', $response);
```

The `validate` method returns `true` in case of success, and throws [PSR-7 message-related exceptions](https://github.com/thephpleague/openapi-psr7-validator#exceptions) from the underlying OpenAPI PSR-7 Message Validator package in case of error.
